“Get beyond love and grief: exist for the good of Man.”

This  new and higher level is about moving beyond the preparation of the self and preparing for oncoming responsibilities, interacting well with others, and beginning the next foundation for future contributions in society.  This involves:

- Obtaining the necessary knowledge, trails, and skills
- Building balance, purpose, and conviction
- Navigating the three leviathans of culture 

  

Some of us, when we are at our most comfortable and confident, see ourselves as supermen looking down on the masses, but put us out of our element and we become just like the masses, confused and clinging to anyone as if they have the answers.  Alternatively if you constantly feel out of your element just like the aforementioned masses return to the Bedrock to assess yourself.  Know that there is often equal benefit and risk to taking on the purposeful quest before you feel you are ready.

What got you here won’t get you there. As we progress through stages in life, rules change. What was good for us in one stage, might not be as good in the next. Doing more of what worked is seldom the answer. As you progress, unlearn what worked and learn what will. Proactivity begets growth, not the other way around. Childhood: after you grow, you are given more responsibilities. Adulthood: after you take responsibilities, you grow (promotion, get partner, etc.) Many miss the latter, because in school we're only taught the former.

People like coherent purpose. We like stories because we appreciate clear direction and compelling story arcs. If you can create a world that’s more clear and compelling than the complex, ambiguous real world, then people will be attracted to that story. And when you invite those people into your world and give them purpose inside your world, and they accept that purpose, then they won’t ever leave. That’s how you get everyone pushing on your system problem all at the same time, without you having to be everywhere all at once.
