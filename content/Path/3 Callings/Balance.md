We need balance. Everything is a spectrum. Unfortunately the further to the edge you are the more difficult it is to see why balance is necessary.  But we need the edges to find the acceptable zone.  With infinite spectrums as soon as one is settled in an acceptable zone a new discourse on a new spectrum arises. It means but can never fully escape the harrowing search and must endure the cultural rhetoric.

- The defining 
- Developing a finesse of navigation to such a level that you can maintain the context of opposing viewpoints and the correct weights for leaning towards or away from those viewpoints
- Cultivating virtues and their counterparts stupidity, laziness
- People who are having a hard time making it often develop a sense that everyone else has it easy.
- Society on a serpent’s back.

- Multicultural vs homogenous
- Red vs blue

- How you handle good times is a poor predictor how you handle bad times without balance
- By balance I don’t mean center, a sword can be 4 feet long yet the balance point is just above this hilt.  And I don’t necessarily mean a fixed point, a dynamic balance can be achieved over a longer frame of time where progressive ideals are the gas and conservative ideals are the brakes, it is the correct application of the two that gets you somewhere without crashing or sitting at a full stop.
