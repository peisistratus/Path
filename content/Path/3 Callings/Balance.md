We need balance. Balance is practical. Balance is the ability to stand or walk without falling over. Balance means not eating too much candy so you don't get a stomachache. Balance involves dividing your time between playing and doing homework.

The idea of balance puts everything on a spectrum. Tip yourself too far one way, you'll fall over, same in the other direction. 

There's also an element of height. Not eating candy you feel fine, eat a bit too much you'll start to feel sick, eat too much and you'll throw up.  

There's also an element of weight.  Homework is required to get done, there will be consequences tomorrow if it's not done, but unlikely there will be consequences if you don't play.  In this spectrum, say it's an hour of time, the homework requires 45 minutes of time to do right and you get 15 minutes of play. The weight of the necessary homework is equal to the time for play.

There are spectrums for ideas too. It's easy to draw lines in American politics, everything on this side is Democrat and everything on this side is Republican. Red vs Blue. But this isn't very helpful so we create names like Center-Left or Far-Right. Other countries create political parties that embody positions on this spectrum.

Everything is a spectrum. Unfortunately the further to the edge you are the more difficult it is to see why balance is necessary.  But we need the edges to find the acceptable zone.  And should you perceive this zone as shifting in the wrong direction you will expand your weight or shift your position farther away to counter balance 

Outline
	**Level 1: Surface Understanding** - Balance means dividing time equally between work and rest to avoid overworking or being lazy.
	**Level 2: Practical Application** - Balance is zero-sum, involves managing different areas of life—career, relationships, health—to ensure none are neglected, leading to overall well-being.
	**Level 3: Holistic Perspective** - Balance is the harmonious interplay of opposites—like chaos and order—that together foster necessary growth and fulfillment in life.
	**Level 4: Philosophical Insight** - Balance is the continuous dance of existence itself, there are many kinds of forces creating local equilibriums and there are many local equilibriums embodying the unity of all opposites.
	**Level 5: Transcendent Realization** - The paradox that balance and imbalance are concepts arising from a limited perspective, one experiences reality as an indivisible whole where all distinctions dissolve and all is expressions of the same underlying reality.

With infinite spectrums as soon as one is settled in an acceptable zone a new discourse on a new spectrum arises. It means but can never fully escape the harrowing search and must endure the cultural rhetoric.

- The defining 
- Developing a finesse of navigation to such a level that you can maintain the context of opposing viewpoints and the correct weights for leaning towards or away from those viewpoints
- Cultivating virtues and their counterparts stupidity, laziness
- People who are having a hard time making it often develop a sense that everyone else has it easy.
- Society on a serpent’s back.

- Multicultural vs homogenous
- Red vs blue

- How you handle good times is a poor predictor how you handle bad times without balance
- By balance I don’t mean center, a sword can be 4 feet long yet the balance point is just above this hilt.  And I don’t necessarily mean a fixed point, a dynamic balance can be achieved over a longer frame of time where progressive ideals are the gas and conservative ideals are the brakes, it is the correct application of the two that gets you somewhere without crashing or sitting at a full stop.
