At the highest level. An intuitive extrapolation of our existence as entities in reality as we know it, the ultimate force or mechanism responsible for our existence. The super-set of all life, all things happening everywhere. Discerning his will requires all fields of human knowledge that currently exist and every one that will exist. To predict reality would be to know something divine.

At one step down there are many Gods. Wisdom, Justice, Equality, Peace, and Love are all ideas that should be worshipped as Gods.

Examples of rituals (greetings, graduations, marriage, interviews, superbowl parties, transitions of power)

Religion unfortunately has ethical prescriptions which may be useful rules of thumb but which are deadly when followed to the letter.

Religion is extremely widespread and popular, and it could not have gotten that way unless it was filling some important human need. No attempt to overthrow religion is likely to be successful unless it addresses this need; it never works to take away from people something that is important to them and offer nothing in its place.

It would be wonderful if we had something in today that has a genuine understanding of how humans react and that benefits of community by creating environments where loving conscious people communicate with each other in a positive way

Conaw: the difference between spirituality and religion is like religion is thing we do together. Where we hold one, another accountable to a higher standard
