Health is one of those terms that draws strong opinions.  I like the fine fettle (state of health, fitness, wholeness, spirit, or form) definition as a good base for all: Health is a freedom very few fully appreciate until they no longer have it, not just a state free from injury and illness but complete physical, mental and social well-being.  It is an ideal to work towards, a journey of improvement, and a routine of maintenance. 

Health is always a system, not a component or series of components.

Personally though I trend more to the temple view: supply the body with good food and quality sleep as often as possible so that I can selectively stress it enough to be able to do whatever I want whenever I want.  I want my body to be capable of lifting heavy things, running long distances, and to be able to do it even if I happen to be tired or hungry or worn-out.  I also believe seeking “better” health through regular exercise, nutritious food, and quality sleep makes the rest of life easier boosting you towards whatever drives you.  I recognize my own view falls farther out on the spectrum than the average human, but know that one persuasive view can make all the difference.

Put another way: _“No man has the right to be an amateur in the matter of physical training. It is a shame for a man to grow old without seeing the beauty and strength of which his body is capable.”_ ― _Socrates_

I will again return to the idea that we are products of our environment.  Here in the United States more than two-thirds of adults are overweight or have obesity.  There is an incredible complex web of reasons why that is the case from quirks of our genetics to incentives in place to further the trend despite the health implications. Tasty high caloric food is cheap and available everywhere, sedentary information and service jobs abound, and not everyone’s willpower works in the domain of health. 

However, I want to focus on resources and dimensions that create health and well-being not on the disease or ailment conditions.  Disease, stress, and ill-health are everywhere and a part of the human condition, but it is our reaction to…

This is a theory created by Aaron Antonovsky called “Salutogenesis” that recognizes disease, stress, and ill-health are everywhere a part of life and the human condition but that the outcomes of this on one’s body and mind are dependent on the adequacy of the individual's management.  That is to say, focus on the health factors that keep you in good health and how can you be helped along to move toward greater health.

Despite the complexity of the issue, the scale of the problem, and the infinite resources already available I will present the distillation of what I have learned in the most straightforward and accessible way I can.  Each section will start with the most basic and widely accepted possible improvements and increase in depth (and likely controversy) from there.

But if you read nothing else, here is the bare minimum advice: You can’t outrun your fork. Sometimes your fork is a proxy for your mental state. Health starts in the kitchen where less processed is better, anything remotely active is better than nothing, and attempt to get the best sleep you can.  

First we have Exercise

Then we have [[Nutrition]]

And finally Sleep
