*Building a way to walk, a path to follow, and a vision for the future*

Behold this lush emergent wondrous life.

Each one of us is a conscious mind inside an organic structure that is currently under the influence of hormones and neurotransmitters. Affected by the last meal we ate and the sum of every meal we have ever eaten.  Based upon on those close to us, nudged by those we interact with, shifted by our community, and molded by the forces of entire cultures dating back thousand of years.  Drawn from a mix of our parents and a long lineage of species billions of years old. A part of a vast diversity that has developed within this one narrow band of survivable conditions in the known universe that ranges roughly five miles below the surface to seven miles high.  Inevitably governed by the fundamental principles of the cosmos and the composition of the stars.

This briefest glimpse from the tiny molecules within us to the scale of galaxies above us creates an staggeringly complex web of interactions inside and around us at every moment.  A web of interconnectedness that is both all consuming wonder and universal suffering, both excruciatingly meaningful and devastatingly meaningless.  It is far too much for any single human to comprehend in total and yet we can snap to any element and toy with it to better understand the whole.  

Collectively, we humans barrel forward in haphazard and uneven fashion accumulating knowledge, loving and feuding, building families and machines of war, raising and razing cities and civilizations.  We have never been better or worse than we are right now and that has always been true. From the harnessing of fire to the harnessing of the atom, and on to whatever great unknown, that will always be true.

Individually, this is a moment to step outside the momentum of your life. This text is a temporary halt right now. A necessary interlude for contemplation, to broaden one's horizons, to chase the ethos of a life lived with intent, and to cultivate and assert one's own will. You don't control the initial trajectory of life: where you were born, who your parents are, what you ate, what you were taught. And you have likely followed or rebelled against the scripts given to you by family and culture for many of your early years.  This has worked out well enough for some and for others has been nothing but debilitating obstacles.

This is the moment to take control of your trajectory. This is the moment you awake to say, I am ready to prepare, to expand, understand.  To say, I want to use my energies towards what is best for myself. I want the best possible future for those I care about. I choose to push forward a better world for all. This trajectory will take you along a path of discovery, one that will contend with your very soul.

Why?

Individually, you realize you are not everything you could be. Collectively, we struggle against rapid progress and all seem to agree that there are deep problems that require corrective solutions. There is a great call for effort, competence, solutions, and meaning.

How?

Let’s start with the radical proposition that neither the world inside you nor the world outside you is anything like it seems. There’s so much more to life than we can tell or perceive. We are imperfect people with incomplete knowledge attempting to live the best lives we can.  This is an attempt to create a bedrock upon which to build a great nobility of character.

- Gain perspective on who you are, where you came from, and where you could go
- Accept the necessary struggle of your life, learn, and struggle forward
- Prepare your [[Body]], mind, and spirit continually  

This is an attempt to further the art of finding truth, generating sense, and accomplishing value from inside a human mind by orienting towards the highest possible good. An ideal that, in the journey towards, we must:

- Emulate the success and joyful moments of those you admire, create and share your own, and to be more of what you want to see in the world
- Negotiate between individuals, across society, and through time for succeeding generations
- Participate in the sense-making of society and the unfolding of balance in an upward spiral from our home to our community to our nation to our planet and beyond

We are humans.  We all breathe and eat and sleep and hope.  We want good things to happen and success, comfort, and satisfaction.  Our hearth must be the pursuit of ideals and parallel effort so that we can explore and progress sustainably, understand the depths of the mind, and produce harmony.

Our home will fill with a golden age producing the abundance of titans, ground swelling love, and a vibrant community fulfilling grand visions with such finesse and heart that life will be worn gloriously by all.

A balancing of the shadows we have long carried into a light that outshines anything we have previously known.
