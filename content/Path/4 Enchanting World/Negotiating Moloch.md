Two hostile and fluctuating components of human society - order and liberty. A smaller community is insecure and a larger one tyrannical. Ideally Greece sought city states cooperating in Pythagorean harmony.

  

**Open Ended Systems for Creativity**

Open ended systems as are where innovation comes from. The innovation comes from the system surprising itself. A system frozen in equilibrium cannot produce new innovation. Open-ended systems aren’t like this. They refuse to fall into equilibrium. Instead, they keep finding new ways to disrupt themselves, continually generating novel outcomes. More interesting still, these novel outcomes aren’t just formless, chaotic noise. Open-ended systems generate upward-spirals of evolutionary complexity.

So, my first heuristic is that an open-ended tool is made up of an alphabet and a mechanism of composition. These two things are the DNA of the tool, and set up the conditions for evolution. For lego, this looks like bricks and dots. For Unix, this looks like programs and pipes.

My second heuristic comes from Van Valen’s Red Queen Hypothesis, a famous evolutionary hypothesis named for the Red Queen in Alice in Wonderland: Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place. When actors in a system compete, they get caught up in coevolutionary loops. If you stay in one place, you’ll fall behind, and this coevolutionary pressure generates all kinds of symbiotic upward-spiraling complexity.

My third heuristic comes from an A-Life paper, “Complex Adaptations and the Evolution of Evolvability" (Wagner, Altenberg, 1996). In evolutionary computer science it was found that the Darwinian process of mutation, recombination, and selection is not universally effective in improving complex systems like computer programs or chip designs. For adaptations to occur, these systems must possess evolvability. For open-ended evolution to occur, the system itself needs to be evolvable. One way to see this is that the system should be able to reprogram itself.

My fourth heuristic is a cheat—human beings are open-ended systems. We’re always changing, adapting, and generating novelty. If you put a human in the loop of an expressive enough system, that system will evolve in open-ended directions.

  

**Culture wars are Long Wars**

Hayek’s campaign was the conviction that policy flowed from the general attitudes, beliefs, and worldview of what he terms “secondhand dealers in ideas.”1 What these people believe today, Hayek maintains, will determine policy in 10-20 years. Secondhand dealers in ideas are not experts in the ideas they peddle; they care less about particulars than the grand sweep of things.

Al-Gharbi is especially good at identifying the institutions and pathways by which ideas spread from these small activist circles to mainstream acceptance today. In his account we see the old pattern recur: like most successful cultural insurgencies, the woke transformation of American life was the fruit of a four decade insurgency. Its victory came first gradually, then suddenly.

Robert Putnam’s Bowling Alone, in the chapter “Generation to Generation,” he describes most of them as effects of cohort change.  The logic of cohort change can be grasped by the graphic at the top of this essay (Putnam includes many similar ones in his book). America’s future is godless not because the God-fearing were convinced of the errors of their faith, but because their children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren never adopted their faith to start out with. Cultures do not change when people replace old ideas with new ones; cultures change when people with new ideas replace the people with old ones.

Cultural insurgents win few converts in their own cohort. They can, however, build up a system of ideas and institutions which will preserve and refine the ideals they hope their community will adopt in the future. The real target of these ideas are not their contemporaries, but their contemporaries’ children and grandchildren. Culture wars are fought for the hearts of the unborn. Future generations will be open to values the current generation rejects outright.
