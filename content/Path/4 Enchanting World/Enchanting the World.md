“There's nothing more frightening than a half-baked do-gooder who knows nothing of the world but takes it upon himself to tell the world what's good for it.”   ― Eiji Yoshikawa, [Musashi](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/347050)  #quotes 

“Think lightly of yourself and deeply of the world” #quotes 

  

Courage - Courage is kinetic.  It initiates movement, action, or fortitude.  Courage exercises strength in different dimensions/realms where there is risk  

We live in a world that’s constantly changing, and if we can’t respond effectively to those changes, we become redundant, frustrated, and useless. Rapid, extraordinary change is the norm. In order to adapt in a way that is useful, keep your options open.
